## TL;DR

Over 3.5 years on Pleo’s design systems team, I worked across design, code, and documentation to strengthen the system’s foundations. I led the introduction of semantic tokens, established accessibility improvements, maintained and governed Figma libraries, and contributed directly to the codebase. This work helped align designers and engineers around a shared language and supported safer, more scalable changes across Pleo’s products.

## Context

I spent 3.5 years on Pleo’s design systems team, working in a cross-functional team of two designers and three engineers. The design system supported both web and mobile products and was used daily by 20+ product designers and 60+ front-end engineers across the organisation.

The team’s responsibility went beyond building and maintaining components. We owned the foundations that made the system coherent, accessible, and scalable as the product and organisation evolved. This meant working across design, code, documentation, and process, and often translating broad or ambiguous needs into clear system-level solutions.

My work spanned several areas, including semantic tokens, accessibility foundations, Figma libraries, code contributions, documentation, and internal workflows. The sections below break down these contributions in more detail.

## Semantic tokens

I led the introduction of semantic tokens to Pleo’s design system by defining the naming system, building Figma token libraries, writing documentation, facilitating onboarding workshops, and migrating components in both Figma and code. This delivered several key benefits:

- **Consistency:** Moving from core to semantic tokens improved visual alignment across the design system and product.
- **Efficiency:** Designers could make faster, more confident decisions by selecting tokens based on meaning (e.g. `color-background-warning`).
- **Scalability:** Product-wide visual changes could be made centrally and rolled out safely.
- **Theming:** The semantic setup enabled both dark mode and product white-labelling.
- **Collaboration:** Semantic tokens gave designers and engineers a shared, intent-based language, improving handoff quality and reducing implementation ambiguity.

## Code contributions

I contributed directly to the design system codebase (React, TypeScript, styled-components) in several ways:

- **Components:** Implemented three core components: Badge, Card, and Tag, defining APIs, variants, and states.
- **Accessibility and styling:** Improved component accessibility and fixed styling issues independently, ensuring parity between Figma and production.
- **Storybook:** Added Storybook stories to document variants, states, and intended usage.
- **Migrations:** Carried out product-level migrations when breaking changes were introduced.
- **Documentation:** Wrote guidelines directly in code and restructured the documentation information architecture for clarity and usability.

This work helped keep design and code aligned, reduced handoff friction, and made the design system easier for product teams to adopt and evolve.

## Accessibility improvements

I led and contributed to a broad set of accessibility improvements across the design system, spanning design, code, documentation, and process.

- **Accessible focus states:** Designed, documented, and implemented a new focus ring that balanced brand expression with WCAG requirements.
- **Form accessibility foundations:** Defined specs and wrote documentation to ensure form components exposed accessible names and descriptions, and communicated required and invalid states correctly to screen readers.
- **Colour accessibility guidance:** Wrote documentation on WCAG-compliant colour usage and created a contrast matrix mapping relevant semantic token pairings, enabling automated contrast testing.
- **Component audits and fixes:** Audited the accessibility of design system components and fixed smaller issues directly in code.
- **Turning audits into action:** Refined and triaged over a hundred findings from an external accessibility audit, separating system-level issues from design system misuse and ensuring the right issues landed in the design system backlog with clear solution directions.
- **More resilient sizing:** Contributed to the shift from `px` to `rem` units to better support user-defined text scaling and accessibility preferences.

## Figma libraries

Together with [Martin Cohen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mart%C3%ADn-cohen/), I maintained and evolved the design system’s Figma libraries covering tokens, components, and brand assets (icons, pictograms, and illustrations). This work ensured the libraries remained a trusted, up-to-date source of truth for 20+ product designers and supported consistent, scalable use of the design system across teams.

My focus areas included:

- **Tokens:** Created and owned the three token libraries (core, semantic, custom), defining their structure and naming conventions and keeping them up to date.
- **Web components:** Contributed primarily to the web component library, growing it to 60+ components while ensuring consistent structure, states, and correct token usage.
- **Code parity:** Actively aligned Figma component APIs with their counterparts in code to reduce handoff friction and implementation ambiguity.
- **Contributions:** Reviewed and guided incoming contributions to maintain quality, consistency, and overall system integrity.

## Figma component checklist

I created a checklist for creating a design system component in Figma, which improved:

- **Quality**: Expectations became explicit and consistent. States, variants, token usage, naming, and documentation were no longer missed or applied inconsistently, resulting in more complete and predictable components and less rework.
- **Speed:** Designers spent less time recalling steps, checking guidelines, or asking questions. Reviews were shorter and more focused, reducing back-and-forth and helping components move faster through the system.
- **Scalability:** Standards were embedded directly in the workflow, reducing reliance on tribal knowledge and enabling contributors to add components with confidence. Updating standards was easier, as changes could be applied centrally.

Finally, by implementing the checklist as a Figma component, it lived directly alongside the work. Designers could reference it while creating components without switching context, reducing cognitive load and increasing adherence to standards.

## Documentation

I wrote and maintained documentation for Pleo’s design system website to support clear, accessible, and consistent use by designers and engineers.

- **Components:** Authored usage guidelines for components, including variants, states, accessibility requirements, and best practices, with supporting visuals and code examples.
- **Patterns:** Documented the “Feedback and status” pattern, outlining principles, status types, related components, and accessibility requirements.
- **Information architecture:** Structured content for quick scanning and easy reference, reducing onboarding time and implementation errors.

This documentation reduced ambiguity during handoff and helped teams use the design system more confidently and consistently.
